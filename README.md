# Java-Game-Engine-v1

My first attempt at creating a java based game engine. This program was developed by me, Matthias Levy, and Viktor Bobůrka, 
as our semestral project for a Java course we took at our collage in the year 2019. The overworld and main game frame (and their related classes) were created by Viktor Bobůrka, 
while the Battle and Shop (related classes and guis) were created by me. 
We do not own the right's to the assets featured in our game engine, we just used them to show that it is possible to make a game with it.
